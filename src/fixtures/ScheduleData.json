A report commissioned by the Alliance in 2015 found that C2C trade in agriculture makes up less than 1% of the global agricultural trade sector, compared to 15% for trade between co-ops and non-co-ops. Meanwhile, co-operatives around the world are solidifying their presence on global trade markets and using e-commerce platforms and methodologies to achieve scale. What can we learn from these examples for national and regional development? How can we borrow and maximise on achievements and reproduce their successes in other parts of the world? This session will present some of these existing platforms and open a discussion for their replication in different regions and sectors for increased C2C trade.",

This session will explore the emerging business models that respond to peoples’ needs and how co-operatives can demonstrate their longevity in providing sustainable livelihoods grounded in solidarity, democracy, and equity. As the situations may be very different in Asia, in Europe, the Americas and in Africa, the session aims also at clarifying the language and concepts around this term of “collaborative economy” and others associated with it, in order to better identify the opportunities for the co-operative movement",

        "description": "Today, co-operative businesses operate on markets where inputs and assets are increasingly ephemeral. Knowledge and information – data – is the new currency. And block chain and artificial intelligence technologies are growing increasingly sophisticated in allowing for the extrapolation of value from all that data. But, who makes money off your tweets? Who controls what Google does with your internet search history? Who owns the robotic systems that generate profits from the data of our lives? We could, if co-operatives got involved. Join this session to discuss the added-value proposition co-operatives bring to these digital opportunities and learn about co-operatively owned structures that are already forging ahead.",

By being at the beginning (producer) and end (retailer) of the food system, agricultural and consumer co-operatives have a very significant role to play not only as individual sectors, but also as a combined force. This is why their intercooperation is so vital for real contributions to be made to the SDGs on global scale. When speaking of direct business relations between the two sectors, the issue of supply chain comes to the forefront. Better co-operation relies on identifying any existing challenges thereof and working together on practical measures to overcome them, such direct sourcing and widening market access for agricultural co-operative produce by its sale in stores run by consumer co-operatives. However, ICAOCCW collaboration could also have a real contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals on global scale.",
